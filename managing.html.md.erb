title: Managing the Message VPN

This topic describes how to manage the Message VPN on a Solace Virtual Message Router (VMR). After Solace Messaging for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) is installed, developers can provision Message VPNs on a VMR by creating instances of the service plans using Apps Manager or the cf Command Line Interface (CLI). Each service instance represents one Message VPN. 

Developers can manage the Message VPN associated with a service instance by connecting to the VMR with the SolAdmin administration tool.

To retrieve the information required to connect to the VMR, perform the following steps:

1. Log in to your deployment and choose the org and space where your Solace Messaging service instance and bound application exists.
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf login
	API endpoint: <span>https:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN

	Email> user<span>@</span>example.com
	Password>
	</pre>
1. View the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable by retrieving the environment variables associated with your bound application:
	<pre class="terminal">
	cf env YOUR-APP
	</pre>
1. Locate your Solace Messaging service instance in `VCAP_SERVICES` and record the following fields:
	* `managementUsername`: The service instance's management username.
	* `managementPassword`: The service instance's management password.
	* `management HttpUris`: The VMR's IP address and management port, in the format `http://IP-ADDRESS:MANAGEMENT-PORT/SEMP/V2`.

	For more information about the `VCAP_SERVICES` fields, see the [Understanding Credentials](credentials.html) topic.
