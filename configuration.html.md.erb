The Tile requires external Solace Virtual Message Routers (VMR) in order to operate.  URIs for each Message Routers
to be enrolled by the Tile must be provided in the `Message Routers Config` Form.

The Message Routers are assumed to be up and running with their admin user setup with password basic authentication.

### Dedicated Message Routers and Shared Message Routers

The `List of dedicated Message Routers (comma delimited)` field accepts a comma separated list of Message Routers
URIs that are to be enrolled.  The URI must contains these fields :

* Scheme (Must be http://)
* Username
* Password
* Host
* SEMP Port

The URI format is : `http://<username>:<password>@<host>:<semp-port>`

The Dedicated Message Routers list contains Message Routers to be enrolled for the `dedicated_vmr` plan
