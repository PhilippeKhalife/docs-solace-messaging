	The URIs must follow the format `http://YOUR-ADMIN-USERNAME:YOUR-PASSWORD@HOST:SEMP-PORT`.
	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ensure the VMRs are running and have their administrator user set up with basic password authentication.</p>
1. Under **Starting Port**, enter a port where the messaging services on the VMRs will start listening from. For example, `7000`.
