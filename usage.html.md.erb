title: Using Solace Messaging for Pivotal Cloud Foundry
owner: Partners

Solace Messaging is the name of the service shown in the services marketplace.

Application developers will need to create an instance of the service, which they will bind to applications
that needs to exchange messages.  This can be achieved from the `cf` command, or in Pivotal's Apps Manager.

For this service an instance equals a **Message VPN** on a Solace Virtual Message Router.
Creating a service instance gives the user permissions to Manage this **Message VPN**.

For this service an application binding equals one client username on the service instance **Message VPN**.
Creating a binding gives an application permissions to access this **Message VPN**.

## From CLI using `cf'

The marketplace can be displayed with the `cf marketplace` command on the CLI.  

Application developers can create an instance of the service with `cf create-service solace-messaging shared-vmr YOUR_SERVICE_INSTANCE`.

Application developers can create an application binding with `cf bind-service YOUR_APP YOUR_SERVICE_INSTANCE`.

Creating a binding gives an application the information required to have access to a **Message VPN**.

## From Pivotal's Apps Manager

In Apps Manager's Marketplace, application developers can create an instance of `solace-messaging`
using one of the service plans.  It is also possible, but not necessary, to bind the new service instance during creation.

Application Bindings can be added to an application from the application's configuration page.
This can be done by accessing the `services` tab, and then clicking `+ Bind a Service` :

<%= image_tag('appsmgr_service_addbinding.png') %>

Then, from the drop down menu the application developers can then pick the service instance the application must be
bound onto, and click `bind`.
