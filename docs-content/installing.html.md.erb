<p id="tableNote" class="note"><strong><sup>1</sup> Note</strong>: You can modify the number of Instances and Persistent disk size when configuring the Solace Messaging for PCF tile for the VMR jobs.
Solace recommends not changing the other parameters for the VMR jobs or any parameters for the non-VMR jobs such as the <code>UpdateServiceBroker</code> job.  For more information, see the <a href="#configure">Configure Solace Messaging for PCF</a> tile below.</p> 

<p id="tableNote" class="note"><strong><sup>2</sup> Note</strong>: A single high-availability Solace Messaging service instance requires three (3) HA VMR job instances to be used. As such the number of HA VMR job instances specified for the HA VMR instances should be multiple of 3. If it is not the remaining job instances will go unused.</p>


## <a id='prereqs'></a>Prerequisites

The Solace Messaging for PCF Service Broker requires the following:

* Java buildpack v3.7.1 or higher.
* The MySQL for PCF tile. When configuring the tile, set the maximum storage in the **Service Plan** section to 100 MB. 
  For information on how to install and configure the tile, see the MySQL for PCF [documentation](http://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/index.html).

##<a id='install'></a> Install Solace Messaging for PCF 

To install Solace Messaging for PCF, perform the following steps:

1. Download the product file from Pivotal Network.
1. Upload the product file on the Ops Manager **Installation Dashboard**.
1. Click **Add** next to the uploaded Solace Messaging tile in the Ops Manager **Available Products** view to add it to your staging area.
1. Click the **Solace Messaging** tile.
1. Follow the steps in the section below to configure the tile.

##<a id='configure'></a> Configure Solace Messaging for PCF

To configure Solace Messaging for PCF, perform the following steps:

1. From the **Settings** tab of the Solace Messaging tile, click **Assign AZs and Networks**.
  <%= image_tag('Network_Config_Form.png') %>
1. Under **Network**, choose the network where Solace Messaging should run.
1. Click **Save**.
1. Click **Message Routing Config**.
    <%= image_tag('VMR_Config_Form.png') %> 
1. Under **Admin user password**, pick a password for the Virtual Message Routers `admin` user.

    <%= image_tag('admin_password_VMR_Config.png') %>
1. Under **Support user password**, pick a password for the Virtual Message Routers `support` user.

    <%= image_tag('support_password_VMR_Config.png') %>
1. Under **Starting Port**, enter a port where the messaging services on the VMRs (e.g. MQTT, REST, or SMF) will start listening from, for example, `7000`.  
The exact port numbers chosen for each service will be based on this starting port and specified in the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable passed to applications. 
For an example, see [Example Environment Variable](credentials.html#example).

    <%= image_tag('Starting_Port_VMR_Config.png') %>
1. Click **Save**.
1. (Optional) Click **TLS Config**. By configuring TLS, you allow messaging between applications and the Solace VMRs to be encrypted. 
Applications requiring encryption would then need to use the TLS-specific URLs passed in the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable. 
For more information about the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable, see [Example Environment Variable](credentials.html#example). 
If TLS is not configured, the TLS specific URLs continue to be passed in the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable but fail to connect to a VMR if used.

    <%= image_tag('TLS_Config_Form.png') %>
1. (Optional) Configure **Message Router's RSA certificate (Server Certificate)** either by pasting in a certificate and private key in PEM format or asking one to be generated by clicking **Generate RSA Certificate**. 
Generated certificates are equivalent to self-signed certificates.

    <%= image_tag('RSA_Certificate_Config_Form.png') %>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The server certifcate configured will be used by all Solace VMRs deployed and as such all VMRs deployed in a PCF instances will have the same identification.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Communication between the Solace Messaging Service Broker and VMRs is also encrypted if a TLS certificate is configured. 
The Service Broker uses the Container Certificate Trust Store Framework to validate the server certificate returned by VMRs. 
So if the framework is not operational when the tile is deployed the Service Broker will be unable to validate server certificates sent by the VMRs and the tile will fail to deploy. 
In development environments it may be acceptable to not require server certificate validation in which case the <strong>Disable RSA Server Certificate validation on the Service Broker (For development only)</strong> checkbox can be selected. 
This checkbox should never be selected in production deployments, instead the framework should be made operational.</p>

1. (Optional) Click **Save**.
1. (Optional) Click **Service Access**

    <%= image_tag('ServiceAccess_Config_Form.png') %>
1. (Optional) Enable the **Enable global access to plans of service solace_messaging** option.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To control access to Solace Messaging service plans on a case-by-case basis, do not enable this option.</p>

1. (Optional) Click **Save**.
1. Click **Resource Config**.
1. Use the drop-down menus to configure the number of VMR job instances that are available in each of the five service plans mentioned above. These job instances are statically created when the tile is deployed. Service instances are then dynamically allocated at service instance creation time, post-deployment, using these job instances. <br/><br/> Five Shared-VMR service instances can be hosted on a single Shared-VMR job instance. As such the maximum number of Shared-VMR service instances that can concurrently exist for the <code>Shared-VMR</code> service plan is equal to five times the number of <code>Shared-VMR</code> job instances. Conversely three HA VMR job instances are required for a single HA VMR service instance. As such the maximum number of HA VMR service instances that can concurrently exist for the <code>Large-HA-VMR</code> and <code>Medium-HA-VMR</code> service plans is equal to one-third the number of their corresponding job instances.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The number of job instances can be increased after the tile is deployed without impacting already bound applications however reducing the number of instances can result in application failure and message loss.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The size of the persistent disk can be changed both before and after deployment. 
  Increasing the size of the persistent disks will impact the service of already bound applications however messages will not be lost. 
  Reducing the size of the persistent disk post-deployment is not recommended and can result in message loss, inoperable VMRs, and/or undefined behaviors.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Solace recommends keeping the default values for **VM Type**.</p>

1. Click **Save**.
1. Click **Installation Dashboard** at the top left corner of the screen to leave the tile configuration and go back to dashboard.
  <% image_tag('Installation_Dashboard_Link.png') %>

1. Click **Apply Changes** to deploy the tile.
1. After the tile has deployed, see the [Creating and Binding Solace Messaging Service Instances](service-instances.html) topic for information about creating instances of the Solace Messaging service and binding them to applications.
